# D&D 5e Homebrew Repository

Welcome to my personal **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition homebrew repository**.  
This repository serves as a centralized workspace for designing, playtesting, and publishing original D&D 5e content, including mechanical rules, formatted supplements, and digital tool integrations.

The goal of this project is to maintain **clean version control**, **clear organization**, and **easy sharing** with players, DMs, and collaborators.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by function rather than by product, allowing content to grow organically over time.
